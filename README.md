#### Description:

The To-Do List App is a command-line application that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. The app is implemented in Python and consists of four main functions: `main`, `add_task`, `remove_task`, and `mark_task_as_completed`.

The `main` function initializes an empty to-do list and provides a menu for users to interact with the app. The `add_task` function allows users to add new tasks to the list, while the `remove_task` function enables users to remove tasks from the list. The `mark_task_as_completed` function marks tasks as completed.

The app uses a simple data structure to store tasks, with each task represented as a dictionary containing the task description and a completion status. The app also includes a `display_todo_list` function to display the current state of the to-do list.

I chose to implement this project because I wanted to create a simple yet useful application that demonstrates my understanding of Python programming concepts. Throughout the development process, I considered various design options, such as using a more complex data structure or implementing additional features. However, I decided to keep the app simple and focused on the core functionality.

Overall, the To-Do List App is a functional and user-friendly application that showcases my programming skills and attention to detail.
